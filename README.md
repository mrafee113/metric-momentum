## TODO

I want to make an app in python.
write me a code in python that manages progresses.
- the app should be able to register a new progress. a progress should have a name (unique), a unit of measurement, a  number of units, and the current state of the progression in units.
- the app should be able to increase progression by 1 unit.
- the app should be able to remove units.
- the app should store its data in a text file (progression per line).
- the app should be able to pretty-print a progression given its name
- the app should be able to pretty-print all progressions.
